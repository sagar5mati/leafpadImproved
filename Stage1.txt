My project is adding support to leafpad for syntax highlighting for C language.
I started with reading the source code of leafpad and looking around codes of other editors having the feature.
I have tried to change the actual in leafpad in some ways so that I can get comfortable in reading the source code.
Although, those changes aren't included in the uploaded source code as they were quite minor.
This allowed me to browse through the source code quite confidently.
I then took up main.c as the first file to read in the source code.
Although not relating to my project, I got a lot of insight in the structure of the source code by reading main.c
I got to know that leafpad uses glib.
I had to understand a lot of functions of glib to understand the main.c file.
I have commented the same in the uploaded source code.
Also, I understood the functions that were called in main.c but were declared elsewhere.
This helped me to simultaneously understand a few other files of the source code.
I also looked up vim editor's source code for an example of syntax highlighting.
This is what I have done in my mini-project uoto now.
All this enabled me to get a proper direction for completing the project.
At this point in my project I know where to add options in menubar for enabling
syntax highlighting and other related stuff.
Further, I would have to think about how I am going to implement syntax highlighting
which would encompass the second stage of my mini-project.
Also now, I have a vague knowledge about glib and its many functions which would help me in writing my code.
